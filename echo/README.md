# Echo module

What does this ting do? It responds to http request on a given port at root (/) or (/api/echo) and sends back a JSON object in the body with a password, a passphrase and some Radix information.

```Response object```

```
{
    "RADIX_APP": "",
    "RADIX_COMPONENT": "",
    "RADIX_ENVIRONMENT": "",
    "HOSTNAME": "",
    "HOSTPLATFORM": "",
    "PASSWORD": "",
    "PASSPHRASE": ""
}
```
[routes/index.js](./routes/index.js) contains the definition of route and most of this apis logic


## Local node development

Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
Run the application
```
npm start
```
Run the application dev mode - automatic restart of server when changes in source code are detected.
```
npm run dev
```
Run tests
```
npm test
```
Run a vulnerability check on dependencies
```
npm audit
```
Lint the Javascript code
```
npm run lint
```
Run the application in debug mode - extensive logging
```
npm run debug
```

### Environment variables

The echo application use the following environment variables:

* ```PORT``` to define which local port to listen to (default is 3001)
* ```NODE_ENV``` with values ```development``` or ```production``` (used by the Express framework)

## Local docker development

To build the image for the Echo app
```
docker build -t echo .
```

To run the Echo app in Docker
```
docker run -it --name=echo --rm -p 3001:3001 echo
```
(replace ```-it``` with ```-d``` to run in detached mode)

## Metrics

Metrics are exposed on the /metrics endpoint. The [example](./app.js) is using the express-prom-bundle module which exposes http request durations. In a Radix cluster metrics are scraped by Prometheus and made available in Graphana. (Remember to set monitoring:true in the radixconfig file)

Optional: Create a [custom metric](https://github.com/siimon/prom-client#histogram) monitoring the time it takes to create a password. It should be possible to separate between how much time it takes for passphrases and password creation. A [histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/histograms/) might be the correct way to measure this.
